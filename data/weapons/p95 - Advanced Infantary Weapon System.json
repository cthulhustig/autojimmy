    "notes": "\"Why the generated weapon doesn't match the example in the Field Catalogue\\n\\n- The manifest in the book doesn't have the Quickdraw -2 modifier for a scope accessory (p46)\\n- The table in the book has the capacity of the rifle, carbine and assault variants as 42 but I think it should actually be 43, a base of 30 for intermediate rifle calibre, plus 20% for the high capacity feature and finally plus 20% for the capacity increase. This would also make the magazine costs slightly different but the rounding that's applied to them probably makes it irrelevant.\\n- The Assault variant in the book has a range of 125m but I think it should be 156m, a base range of 250m for intermediate rifle calibre (p39) plus 25% for the advanced projectile weapon feature (p33)\\n\""
