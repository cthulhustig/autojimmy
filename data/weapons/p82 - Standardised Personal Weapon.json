    "notes": "\"Why the generated weapon doesn't match the example in the Field Catalogue\\n\\n- The manifest in the book has +20% receiver cost for the bullpup feature but the rules say it's +25% (p33)\\n- The manifest in the book has Normal as the Physical Signature for light rifle calibre but the rule say Low (p39)\\n- The manifest in the book doesn't have the Damage -1 modifier for carbine barrel (p42)\\n- The manifest in the book doesn't have the Quickdraw -2 modifier for the scope accessory (p46)\\n- The table in the book has a magazine cost of Cr30 but I think it should be Cr33.8. A base of Cr0.4 per round, multiplied by an ammo capacity of 27 finally adding 1% of the weapons base cost as the cost of a standard magazine its self.\\nThere is possibly a rules ambiguity around how much a standard magazine without the ammo costs. The rules say it's 1% of the weapons purchase price (p45) but it's not clear if the weapon purchase price includes other weapon accessories. I'd assume that it doesn't as I can't see why the magazine cost would be affected by if the weapon had a silencer fitted.\\n\""
