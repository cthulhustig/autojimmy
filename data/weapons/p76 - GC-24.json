    "notes": "\"Why the generated weapon doesn't match the example in the Field Catalogue\\n\\n- The manifest in the book has the correct receiver cost modifiers listed but it looks like the total receiver cost has just been calculated incorrectly, it should be Cr1212.75\\n- The manifest in the book has a base ammo capacity of 40 but I think it should be 30. A base 10 for a handgun receiver (table on p31) multiplied by 3 for gauss calibre (table on p31) then minus 50% for the very compact feature (p35). This would also affect the magazine cost in the table.\\n- The manifest in the book doesn't give a Physical Signature but I think it should be High, a base of Normal then +1 for a short barrel\\n- The description in the book mentions a special compact magazine which I assume is why the magazine cost in the table doesn't match\\n\""
