    "notes": "\"Why the generated weapon doesn't match the example in the Field Catalogue\\n\\n- The manifest in the book doesn't have the 150% cost and 50% weight increase for anti-material rifle calibre (p37). This also has the knock on effect of making the magazine cost in the table incorrect as the cost of a standard magazine is 1% of the weapon purchase price (p45)\\n- The manifest in the book has the base range as 500m for anti-material rifle calibre but the rules say it's 1000 (p39)\\n- The manifest in the book doesn't have the Quickdraw -2 modifier for the scope Accessory (p46)\\n- The manifest in the book has a Quickdraw -1 for a Long barrel but I can't see that in the rules (p42). Is it maybe meant to be heavy, that would give a Quickdraw -1? If it is then I don't think the barrel cost and weight are taking the x2 multiplier for a heavy barrel into account (p43)\\n- The table in the book doesn't seem to take the -1D damage modifier that an assault barrel into account. The modifier would reduce the base damage of the weapon to 4D-3. The result of this is the damage would be 6D-3 when using explosive ammo would be 4D-3 when using pellet ammo.\\n\""
