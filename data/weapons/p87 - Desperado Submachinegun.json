    "notes": "\"Why the generated weapon doesn't match the example in the Field Catalogue\\n\\n- The manifest in the book has the wrong value for the total receiver cost, Cr300 + 20% should be Cr360 not Cr330\\n- The table in the book has Inaccurate 1 but that seems to be incorrect. I suspect this is meant to be from the description of the Desperado (p87), but that says it should be Inaccurate -2. If needed the Inaccurate trait can be added by adding the Low Quality receiver feature.\""
