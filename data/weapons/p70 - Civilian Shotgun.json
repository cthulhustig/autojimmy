    "notes": "\"Why the generated weapon doesn't match the example in the Field Catalogue\\n\\n- The manifest in the book has a base receiver weight of 3kg for a longarm but the rules say it should be 2.5kg (p31)\\n- The manifest in the book has Quickdraw -1 and half weight for additional partial-multi-barrels when the rules read like that's only for complete multi-barrel weapons (p40)\\n- The manifest in the book has a Physical Signature of Normal for light smoothbore calibre but the rules say it should be High (p39)\\n- The manifest in the book has Inaccurate -1 for light smoothbore but the rules say it should be -2 (p39)\\n- The description in the book would suggest this type of weapon would have a fixed magazine feed but the manifest doesn't mention it or the 10% cost and weight reduction that would go with it (p45)\\n- The table in the book has Cr Varies for the Sawed-Off variant using explosive ammo. It's not clear why it would vary and not just be Cr15 for explosive ammo, calculated as base Cr1.25 per round, multiplied by 6 for explosive ammo and multiplied by the capacity of 2\\n\\n\\n\\n\""
