    "notes": "\"Why the generated weapon doesn't match the example in the Field Catalogue\\n\\n- The description in the book would suggest this type of weapon would have a fixed magazine feed but the manifest doesn't mention it or the 10% cost and weight reduction that would go with it (p45)\\n- The table in the book doesn't have the Bulky trait for being an uncompensated weapon weighing under 2kg that uses  heavy handgun ammo (p36)\\n- The table in the book has Slow Loader 4 but I can't find the rule that causes that\\n- The table in the book has the magazine cost as Cr40 for distraction ammo but I think it should be Cr16, a base of Cr1 per round, multiplied by 4 for distraction ammo (p50) and finally multiplied by the capacity of 4\\n- The table in the book has the magazine cost as Cr40 for explosive ammo but I think it should be Cr24, a base of Cr1 per round, multiplied by 6 for explosive ammo (p50) and finally multiplied by the capacity of 4\\n\""
