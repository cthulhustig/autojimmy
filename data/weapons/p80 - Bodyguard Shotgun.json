    "notes": "\"Why the generated weapon doesn't match the example in the Field Catalogue\\n\\n- The description in the book says this is a standard pump action shotgun which would suggest it would have a fixed magazine feed but the manifest doesn't mention it or the 10% cost and weight reduction that would go with it (p45)\\n- The manifest in the book has the base ammo capacity as 6 for standard smoothbore calibre in a longarm receiver but the rules say it should be 10 (p36)\\n- The manifest in the book has Inaccurate -1 for standard smoothbore but the table on p39 says -2\\n- The manifest in the book has Cr50 for a laser pointer but the rule say it's Cr200 (p46)\\n- The table in the book has Normal as the Physical Signature where as the manifest (correctly) has High (p39)\\n- The table in the book has the ammo capacity and magazine cost of the Pointguard variant as half the Bodyguard variant but I'm not sure why, if it's just a shorter barrel as suggested by the description then that wouldn't affect ammo capacity\\n\""
