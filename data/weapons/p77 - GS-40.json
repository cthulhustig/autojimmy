    "notes": "\"Why the generated weapon doesn't match the example in the Field Catalogue\\n\\n- The manifest in the book has a base ammo capacity of 40 but I think it should be 30, base 10 for a handgun receiver (table on p31) * 3 for Gauss (table on p31) then -50% for the very compact feature (p35). This would also make the magazine cost in the table wrong.\\n- The manifest in the book doesn't give a Physical Signature, I assume it should be the base Normal\\n- The table in the book has a damage of 3D for the Navy variant but following the rules it would be 3D-1. The Navy variant suffers no Penetration reduction due to barrel type so has a score of 2. The rules (p18) say the AP increase causes a damage reduction of 1 per 2 full dice of damage. With a base damage of 3D this would result in a modified damage of 3D-1.\\n- The table in the book has Quickdraw 4 for the Navy variant but I think it should be 6, a base 4 for handgun receiver then +2 for assault barrel\\n\""
