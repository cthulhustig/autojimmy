    "notes": "\"Why the generated weapon doesn't match the example in the Field Catalogue\\n\\n- The manifest in the book has +15% receiver weight for heavy handgun calibre but the rules say the weight is reduced by 15% (p36). In this case I think it's actually the rules that is wrong as weight reduction seems odd for heavy ammo\\n- The manifest in the book doesn't have the Penetration -1 modifier for a handgun barrel (p42)\\n- The table in the book doesn't have the Range reduction or Inaccurate -1 modifier for the suppressor accessory (p44)\\n- The table in the book doesn't have the Bulky trait for being an uncompensated weapon weighing under 2kg that uses  heavy handgun ammo (p36)\\n- I think the suppressed variant is using a standard suppressor but that would mean the cost of Cr415 is incorrect, I think it should be Cr451\\n\""
