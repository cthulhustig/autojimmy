    "notes": "\"Why the generated weapon doesn't match the example in the Field Catalogue\\n\\n- The manifest in the book has a base receiver weight of 3kg for a longarm receiver when the rules say it should be 2.5kg (table on p31)\\n- The manifest has a base range of 125m for a Black Powder Rifle. I assume this is an Archaic Rifle Calibre which should have a range of 150m (p39).\\n- The table in the book has a damage of 3D-2 but the rules say it should be 3D-3 (p39)\\n- I would have thought a single shot black powder weapon would have a fixed magazine feed but the manifest doesn't mention it or the 10% cost and weight reduction that would go with it (p45)\\n\""
