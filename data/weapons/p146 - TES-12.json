    "notes": "\"Why the generated weapon doesn't match the example in the Field Catalogue\\n\\n- The manifest in the book has a Quickdraw -1 for a long barrel but I can't see that in the rules (p42)\\n- The manifest in the book doesn't have the Quickdraw -2 modifier for the scope Accessory (p46)\\n- The table in the book has the Range for the TES-12 as 626m but it should be 687.5m. The values in the manifest are correct, they've just been applied incorrectly, it looks like the +10% increase for a long barrel hasn't been applied\\n- The table in the book has the Damage for the TES-12 as 8D but that doesn't take into account the +3 for Improved Beam Focus\\n- The table in the book has the Range for the TEA-12 as 450m but I think it should be 562.5, a base of 500 for a large laser plus 25% for the efficient beam generator feature and finally minus 10% for a carbine barrel \\n- The table in the book has the Damage for the TEA-12 as 8D but that doesn't seem to take into account the fact that the max damage of a carbine barrel is 4D (p64) or the +3 for the improved beam focus feature\\n- The table in the book has Quickdraw -4 for the TEA-12 but I think it should be -10\\n- The cost in the book for the TEA-12 appears to be incorrect, I don't think it's taking into account the fact a bipod wouldn't be compatible with a carbine barrel (p43) so wouldn't be included in the cost\""
