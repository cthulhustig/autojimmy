    "notes": "\"Why the generated weapon doesn't match the example in the Field Catalogue\\n\\n- The manifest in the book has a base ammo cost of Cr200 for low-recoil calibre but the rules say Cr150 (p39)\\n- The manifest in the book has a cost of Cr45 for the modularisation furniture but I think it should be Cr90 as it's 20% of the receiver cost (p43) \\n- The manifest in the book doesn't have the 20% ammo capacity reduction due to low-recoil calibre (p39). This would mean the capacities and magazine costs for the different variants in the table are wrong\\n- The table in the book has Quickdraw 6 but the manifest (correctly) has it as 8. The weapon description also says it's 8.\\n- The table in the book doesn't take the Damage -1 modifier for a carbine barrel into account (p42)\\n- The table in the book has the range of the carbine variant as 45m but I think it should be 36m as the base range of low recoil calibre ammo is 40m (p39) and a carbine barrel reduces range by 10% (p42)\""
