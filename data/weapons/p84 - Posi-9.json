    "notes": "\"Why the generated weapon doesn't match the example in the Field Catalogue\\n\\n- The manifest in the book doesn't have the Physical Signature -1 modifier for advanced projectile weapon feature (p33)\\n- The table in the book has the same magazine cost for the burst/auto variants as for the standard variants. As the cost of a magazine is 1% of the weapons purchase cost (p45) you would expect the magazine cost to increase for the variants due to the weapons purchase price changing. I suspect the reason for this may relate to the fact the description talks about converting an existing weapon to burst/auto so it would still be the same magazine.\\n\""
