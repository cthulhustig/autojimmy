    "notes": "\"Why the generated weapon doesn't match the example in the Field Catalogue\\n\\n- The manifest in the book has a base cost of Cr75 for the standard gauss calibre but the rules (p39) say it's Cr50.\\n- The manifest in the book has an Emissions signature of Low for standard gauss calibre but the rules (p39) say it should be Normal.\\n- The manifest in the book doesn't have the Damage -2 modifier for a carbine barrel (p42)\\n- The table in the book has an AP 3 but I think it should be 5. Penetration +2 for standard gauss calibre would mean AP 1 plus 1 per full dice of damage, -1 damage per 2 full dice of damage (p18). With a damage of 4D this would mean an AP of 5 and Damage -2 modifier\\n- It's not clear what configuration the Support Weapon variant has. The description mentions a longer, heavier barrel. The range of 600m would suggest a Rifle barrel but in that case the Damage, Weight, Cost, Magazine and Quickdraw values in the book are wrong\\n\""
