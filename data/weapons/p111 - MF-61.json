    "notes": "\"Why the generated weapon doesn't match the example in the Field Catalogue\\n\\n- The manifest in the book doesn't list a stock however the picture of the weapon clearly shows one. The weapon here is configured as stockless to most closely match the manifest in the book.\\n- The table in the book has Extreme for the Emission Signature but I can't find any rules that cover Emission Signature for a projector\\n- The table in the book doesn't give a value for the Incendiary. The Damage and Burn trait would suggest advanced fuel is being used which would make the Incendiary value 1D3 + 1 (p61)\\n- The description in the book mentions reloading using special fuel modules for reloading, I assume this is why the magazine cost is different\\n\""
