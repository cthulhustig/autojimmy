This also has the knock on effect of making the magazine cost in the table incorrect as the cost of a standard magazine is 1% of the weapon purchase price (p45)\\n- The manifest in the book has a base range of 50m for heavy handgun calibre but the rules say 60 (p39)\\n- The manifest in the book doesn't have the Damage -1 modifier for a carbine barrel (p42)\\n- The manifest in the book has a Quickdraw +1 modifier for the quickdraw feature but the rules say it should be +2 (p34)\\n\""
